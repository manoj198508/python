# Multi threading, Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and Multiprocessing
""""""
# 1. threading.Thread - Independent thread of execution.
"""
Used  to create, start and manage a thread that runs concurrently in main program.
Syntax: threading.Thread(group=None, target=None, name=None, args=(), kwargs={}, daemon=None)

group   Reserved for future use; always None.
target	The callable (function) to be executed in the thread.
name	Thread name (optional, defaults to "Thread-N").
args	Tuple of positional arguments for target.
kwargs	Dict of keyword arguments for target.
daemon	Boolean – whether the thread is daemon (background).

Methods:
.start()	        Starts the thread’s activity (calls run() internally).
.run()              Defines the thread’s behavior (override in subclass).
.join(timeout=None)	Waits for thread to finish (optional timeout).
.is_alive()	        Checks if the thread is still active.
.setName(name)  	Set thread’s name.
.getName()	        Get thread’s name.
.daemon	            If True, thread ends when main program ends.
